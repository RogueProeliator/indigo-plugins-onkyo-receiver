# Introduction
This Indigo plugin allows Indigo to act as a remote display and/or control for a network-connected Onkyo Receiver. All commands/buttons found on the standard remote can be sent to the receiver as well as many additional commands not readily available for direct access (normally requiring menu navigation). The status of many different aspects of the receiver is available via Indigo Device states.
